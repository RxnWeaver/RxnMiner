A. 5-(1-(4-Chlorophenyl)ethylidene)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (1).2,3 An oven-dried 1000 mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 3 cm oval Teflon®-coated magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum, is purged with nitrogen. The flask is charged with THF (300 mL) and cooled to 0 °C (bath temp) in an ice bath (Note 1). An oven-dried 100 mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum is charged with dichloromethane (50 mL), and then titanium (IV) chloride (18.0 mL, 31.1 g, 164 mmol, 2.13 equiv) is added and the flask is swirled for 10 s (Notes 2 and 3). The TiCl4 solution is added to the flask containing THF in four portions via a 20 mL Norm-ject plastic syringe at a rate of 4.3 mL/min with stirring (Note 4). During this addition smoke forms inside the reaction flask and the mixture becomes a cloudy yellow suspension. An oven-dried 250 mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (11.1 g, 77.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and THF (80 mL). The flask is sealed with a rubber septum and purged with nitrogen before 4'-chloroacetophenone (10.1 mL, 12.0 g, 77.8.9.10 mol, 1.01 equiv) is added via syringe. The flask is swirled until the solid has dissolved (<2 min) (Notes 5 and 6). The Meldrum's acid/4'-chloroacetophenone solution is added to the reaction flask containing TiCl4 via cannula over a period of 10 min. During the addition, the mixture changes color from bright yellow to dark yellow/brown. The 250 mL flask is rinsed with 5 mL of THF, which is rapidly transferred to the reaction via cannula. Pyridine (31.5 mL, 30.7 g, 388 mmol, 5.04 equiv) is then added via a 20 mL syringe in 2 portions at a rate of 4.3 mL/min (Note 7). During this addition, a red color is observed initially and the mixture becomes a muddy brown suspension by the end of the addition. The vigorously stirred reaction is kept at 0 °C for 1 h and then allowed to stir at room temperature for 24 h. The mixture is cooled to 0 °C using an ice-water bath and 150 mL of deionized water is added. The stir bar is removed and the reaction is transferred to a 1000 mL separatory funnel with the assistance of 50 mL of deionized water and 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The layers are partitioned and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 150 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over MgSO4 (14 g, <2 min), filtered through a 7 cm diameter filter funnel packed with cotton into a 2 L round-bottomed flask, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 20 mmHg). The resulting dark yellow oil is dissolved in ethyl acetate (200 mL), which is washed sequentially with saturated NaHCO3, (2 x 100 mL) and brine (150 mL) and then dried over MgSO4 (6 g, <2 min) (Note 8). The mixture is filtered through a 7 cm diameter filter funnel packed with cotton and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 20 mmHg) to obtain a bright yellow solid (Note 9). The solid is dissolved in ethyl acetate (50 mL) and transferred, with rinsing, to a 250 mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 20 mmHg) (Note 9). Methanol (60 mL) and a 1 cm rod-shaped magnetic stirring bar are added and the mixture is placed in an oil bath heated to 50 °C with stirring until the solid dissolves (20 min) (Note 10). The flask is removed from the oil bath and swirled gently to dissolve any solid on the walls of the flask, and then the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature (1 h) before being placed in an ice-water bath for 1 h. The solid is collected by suction filtration (room temperature, ~20 mmHg) through a Büchner funnel equipped with a filter paper and is washed with 30 mL of methanol that has been cooled to -25 °C. The nearly colorless needles are pulverized using a mortar and pestle before being dried under reduced pressure (1 mmHg, 1 h, room temperature) to afford 13.2-13.8 g (61-64%) of 5-(1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione [1] as an off-white powder (Notes 11, 12, 13, and 14).
B. (R)-5-(2-(4-Chlorophenyl)butan-2-yl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (2).3 An oven-dried 250 mL, two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a 2 cm rod-shaped Teflon®-coated magnetic stirring bar and a thermocouple is charged with copper (II) trifluoromethanesulfonate (322 mg, 0.890 mmol, 2.5 mol %) then connected to a vacuum line and placed under reduced pressure (0.5 mmHg) before being placed in an oil bath heated to 100 °C (Note 15). The flask is held at this temperature for 3 h before the flask is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to room temperature (30 min) while still under reduced pressure. The flask is opened to air and (S)-2,2´-binaphthoyl-(R,R)-di(1-phenylethyl)aminoyl-phosphine4 (961 mg, 1.78 mmol, 5.0 mol%) is quickly added before the flask is sealed with a rubber septum and purged with argon (Note 16). 1,2-Dimethoxyethane (45 mL) is then added via syringe and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min before being placed in an isopropanol bath maintained at -40 °C using an immersion cooler (Notes 17 and 18). Diethylzinc (7.3 mL, 8.8 g, 71 mmol, 2.0 equiv) is added via a 10 mL gas-tight syringe under argon over 10 min and the reaction is allowed to stir for 15 min (Note 19).

Set-up for Step B
An oven-dried 100 mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum is purged with argon and charged with 5-(1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (1) (10.0 g, 35.6 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (35 mL). The flask is swirled to dissolve the solid (1 min) before being transferred to the reaction by cannula over a period of 10 min. 1,2-Dimethoxyethane (5 mL) is used to rinse the 100 mL flask, which is transferred to the reaction by cannula in 30 s and the reaction is allowed to stir for 24 h. While still at -40 °C, hydrochloric acid (100 mL, 2 M) is added to the reaction over 2 min (Note 20). Then ethyl acetate (50 mL) is added. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction is allowed to stir for 10 min in a room temperature water bath. The mixture is transferred to a 500 mL separatory funnel with the assistance of deionized water (50 mL) and ethyl acetate (50 mL). The layers are partitioned and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed once with 100 mL of brine and dried over MgSO4 (6 g, <2 min), filtered through a 7 cm diameter filter funnel packed with cotton and concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 20 mmHg). The resulting white solid is mixed with dichloromethane (30 mL) to form a suspension, then subjected to flash chromatography (350 g silica, 60 cm x 5 cm inner diameter, 200 mL fractions) using 6 L of 9:1 hexanes/ethyl acetate as the eluent (Notes 21 and 22). The product is found in fractions 11-24, which are concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 20 mmHg) followed by removal of residual ethyl acetate under reduced pressure (23 °C, 5 mmHg, 30 min) to obtain 8.8-8.9 g (79-80% yield, 97:3-98:2 er) of (R)-5-(2-(4-chlorophenyl)butan-2-yl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione as a white solid (Notes 23, 24, and 25).
C. (R)-3-(4-Chlorophenyl)-3-methylpentanoic acid (3).3 A 100 mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a 1 cm oval Teflon®-coated magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser is charged with (R)-5-(2-(4-chlorophenyl)butan-2-yl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (8.00 g, 25.7 mmol, 1.00 equiv), pyridine (47.0 mL, 45.8 g, 579 mmol, 22.5 equiv) and deionized water (4.7 mL, 4.7 g, 0.26 mol, 10 equiv) then the condenser is equipped with a rubber septum and the apparatus is purged with nitrogen (Note 7). The apparatus is placed in an oil bath preheated to 118 °C and the brownish yellow solution is allowed to stir for 4 h under nitrogen. The reaction is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool for 10 min before being concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 °C, 20 mmHg) to obtain a brownish yellow oil. The residue is cooled to 0 °C in an ice-water bath before being treated with 3M hydrochloric acid (40 mL) and allowed to stir for 5 min (Note 20). The resulting biphasic solution is diluted with methyl t-butyl ether (40 mL) and transferred to a 125 mL separatory funnel. The layers are partitioned and the aqueous layer is extracted with methyl t-butyl ether (3 x 40 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over MgSO4 (6 g, <2 min) and filtered through a 4 cm diameter filter funnel packed with cotton before being concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 20 mmHg). The resulting oil is subjected to flash chromatography (100 g silica, 60 cm x 5 cm inner diameter, 200 mL fractions) using 2 L of hexanes:ethyl acetate (7:1) as the eluent (Note 22). The product is collected from fractions 6-15, which are concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 20 mmHg) followed by removal of residual ethyl acetate under reduced pressure (23 °C, 5 mmHg, 30 min) to obtain 5.5-5.7 g (94-98%) of (R)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylpentanoic acid [3] as a pale yellow oil (Notes 26, 27 and 28).

Working with Hazardous Chemicals
The procedures in Organic Syntheses are intended for use only by persons with proper training in experimental organic chemistry. All hazardous materials should be handled using the standard procedures for work with chemicals described in references such as "Prudent Practices in the Laboratory" (The National Academies Press, Washington, D.C., 2011; the full text can be accessed free of charge at http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12654). All chemical waste should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. For general guidelines for the management of chemical waste, see Chapter 8 of Prudent Practices.
In some articles in Organic Syntheses, chemical-specific hazards are highlighted in red "Caution Notes" within a procedure. It is important to recognize that the absence of a caution note does not imply that no significant hazards are associated with the chemicals involved in that procedure. Prior to performing a reaction, a thorough risk assessment should be carried out that includes a review of the potential hazards associated with each chemical and experimental operation on the scale that is planned for the procedure. Guidelines for carrying out a risk assessment and for analyzing the hazards associated with chemicals can be found in Chapter 4 of Prudent Practices.
The procedures described in Organic Syntheses are provided as published and are conducted at one's own risk. Organic Syntheses, Inc., its Editors, and its Board of Directors do not warrant or guarantee the safety of individuals using these procedures and hereby disclaim any liability for any injuries or damages claimed to have resulted from or related in any way to the procedures herein.
3. Discussion
The catalytic asymmetric formation of all carbon benzylic quaternary centres is an important goal in organic chemistry as these moieties are ubiquitous in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Conjugate addition of organometallic reagents to tri- and tetrasubstituted alkenes activated by carbonyl, nitro or sulfone groups is an efficient method that can be used to synthesize these motifs. The conjugate addition of dialkylzinc reagents to 5-ylidene Meldrum's acid derivatives presented herein is a flexible and convenient method to perform this transformation because the substrates are readily prepared by Knoevenagel condensation2 of various commercially available aryl ketones and the conjugate addition products may undergo a wide variety of transformations. In addition, the substrate scope is broad as the reaction tolerates numerous functional groups.3,5,6,7,8
v92p0182-2.jpg
As shown in Table 1, asymmetric conjugate addition reactions of 5-(1-arylalk-1-ylidene) Meldrum's acid derivatives occur in good to excellent yield and excellent enantiomeric excess for 3- and 4-substituted aryl groups, although no reaction is obtained for 2-substituted aryl groups due to steric reasons.3,7 The reaction is successful when R is a primary alkyl group but no addition occurs for secondary alkyl groups; however, both primary and secondary alkyls are tolerated as the nucleophile, although poor results have been obtained for dimethylzinc under these conditions (it has been shown that dimethylzinc adds effectively under modified conditions).6
